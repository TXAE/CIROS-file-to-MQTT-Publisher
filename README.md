# CIROS-file-to-MQTT-Publisher

Student thesis in the 6th theoretical semester of my studies in electrical engineering - automation with Prof. Dr. Bozena Lamek-Creutz, DHBW

This script interfaces with two Mitsubishi robots, an RV-3SDB an an RH-6SDH5520, that are part of a Festo modular production system located at DHBW Mannheim.
It reads the robot data directly from TCP-packets and publishes the data to an MQTT-broker.
